These lines of code are useful for a text-to-speech task and for speeding up audio files. 
I created these functions to generate audio stimuli from text for an fMRI experiment, using Google's gTTS. Since they have to stay within a specific range of length, I wrote another function allowing to speed up the files. Original duration and sped up duration are stored in an excel file.
